## [Permissions](https://github.com/lucko/fabric-permissions-api)
You need to be an operator or have these permissions to be able to use the mod
- `vanish.command.vanish` - Access to `/vanish` command
- `vanish.command.vanish.reload` - Use `/vanish reload` to reload the config
- `vanish.command.vanish.other` - Set the vanish-status of others

## Developers
Add the modrinth maven repository to your `build.gradle`.
```gradle
repositories {
    // There might be other repos there too, just add it at the end
    maven { url "https://api.modrinth.com/maven" }
}
```
Declare vanish as an optional dependency!
```gradle
dependencies {
    // You will have other dependencies here too
    modImplementation "maven.modrinth:vanish:[VERSION]"
}
```
Before using the API you need to make sure the mod is actually loaded, by checking `FabricLoader.getInstance().isModLoaded("melius-vanish");`. 
If the mod is present you can use [VanishAPI](src/main/java/me/drex/vanish/api/VanishAPI.java) and [VanishEvents](src/main/java/me/drex/vanish/api/VanishEvents.java) to integrate your own mods.
